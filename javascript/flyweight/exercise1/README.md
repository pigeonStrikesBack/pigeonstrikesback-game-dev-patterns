# Exercise 1: Reusable Trees  

## Goal

Create a scene with multiple trees.  

## Instructions

- Create one `TreeType` object that holds a shared texture and color.  
- Create multiple `Tree` objects that store position and refer to the same `TreeType`.  
- Draw all trees on screen using the same texture with different positions.  

## Bonus

Add random scales and colors to the extrinsic state and pass them to the draw call.

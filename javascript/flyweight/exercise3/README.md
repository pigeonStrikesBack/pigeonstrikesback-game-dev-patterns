# Exercise 3: Tile Map with Shared Tile Textures

## Goal:
Draw a 10x10 tile map where each tile is either "grass," "water," or "stone."

## Instructions:
- Create one TileType object per texture (3 in total).
- Each tile object only stores x, y, and a reference to one TileType.
- Render all tiles with their shared textures.

## Bonus
On click, change a tile type by assigning it a different TileType.

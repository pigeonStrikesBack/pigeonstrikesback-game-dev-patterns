Objective:

Implement a basic Finite State Machine (FSM) to handle movement (walking and jumping) for a simple character in Phaser. The character should respond to WASD keys for movement and the spacebar to jump.

Key Concepts:

Finite State Machine (FSM): FSM manages the current state of the character (e.g., standing, walking, jumping) and transitions between states based on user input.

State Transitions: The FSM transitions between different states based on user actions like pressing W, A, or D for movement and jumping.

## Definition

### Gang of Four's definition

The provided sources do not contain a definition of the Bytecode pattern from the Gang of Four.

### Robert Nystrom's definition

Give behavior the **flexibility of data by encoding it as instructions for a virtual machine**. An instruction set defines the low-level operations that can be performed. A series of instructions is encoded as a sequence of bytes. A virtual machine executes these instructions one at a time, using a stack for intermediate values. By combining instructions, complex high-level behavior can be defined.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1: Defining a lot of behavior

The Bytecode pattern is useful when you have a **lot of behavior** that needs to be defined.

### Use case 2: Unsuitable implementation language

Use it when your gameâ€™s **implementation language isnâ€™t a good fit** because itâ€™s too low-level, iterating on it takes too long, or it has too much trust. For example, if you want to ensure the behavior being defined canâ€™t break the game, you need to sandbox it from the rest of the codebase.

### Use case 3: Supporting modding

When you want to **support modding** and allow users to create their own game logic without needing a full compiler toolchain or risking crashing the game.

### Use case 4: Easy modification and reloading

For behavior that needs to be **easily modifiable** and **reloadable** without patching the game executable.

### Use case 5: Physical separation of behavior

When behavior needs to be **physically separate from the rest of the executable**.

## General Examples

### Example 1: Simple Instruction Set

```cpp
enum Instruction {
  INST_SET_HEALTH      = 0x00,
  INST_SET_WISDOM      = 0x01,
  INST_SET_AGILITY     = 0x02,
  INST_PLAY_SOUND      = 0x03,
  INST_SPAWN_PARTICLES = 0x04
};
```
This enumerates a simple set of instructions where each operation is assigned a byte value. A spell can then be encoded as a list of these bytes.

```cpp
switch (instruction) {
  case INST_SET_HEALTH:
    // ...
    break;
  case INST_PLAY_SOUND:
    // ...
    break;
  // ... other cases
}
```
This shows how a virtual machine can interpret a single bytecode instruction by using a switch statement to dispatch to the corresponding game logic.

### Example 2: Stack-Based VM Instruction

```cpp
enum Instruction {
  INST_LITERAL       = 0x00,
  INST_SET_HEALTH    = 0x01,
  // ...
};

class VM {
private:
  void push(int value) { /* ... */ }
  int pop() { /* ... */ }
  void setHealth(int wizard, int amount) { /* ... */ }
public:
  void interpret(char bytecode[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      char instruction = bytecode[i];
      switch (instruction) {
        case INST_SET_HEALTH: {
          int amount = pop();
          int wizard = pop();
          setHealth(wizard, amount);
          break;
        }
        case INST_LITERAL: {
          int value = bytecode[++i];
          push(value);
          break;
        }
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
};
```
This example demonstrates a simplified stack-based virtual machine. The `INST_LITERAL` instruction pushes a value onto the stack, and `INST_SET_HEALTH` pops the wizard and amount from the stack before setting the health.

## PROS and CONS

**PROS**

-   Provides **flexibility of data**, allowing behavior to be defined in separate data files, making modification and reloading easier without recompilation.
-   Enables **sandboxing** of behavior, preventing potentially harmful code from breaking the game engine.
-   Offers **better performance** compared to higher-level interpretations like the Interpreter pattern.
-   Results in a **smaller footprint** as bytecode is typically more compact than other representations of behavior.

**CONS**

-   It is the **most complex pattern** and should not be used lightly, requiring the implementation of a virtual machine.
-   Necessitates a **front-end (compiler or authoring tool)** to translate a higher-level representation of behavior into bytecode.
-   Presents **debugging challenges** as standard debugging tools are not directly applicable to custom bytecode.
-   Carries the **risk of language creep**, where the instruction set can grow in an ad-hoc way if its scope is not carefully controlled.

## Conclusion

The Bytecode pattern offers a powerful approach to defining game behavior by encoding it as instructions for a virtual machine, providing benefits like flexibility, sandboxing, and improved performance over direct interpretation. However, it introduces significant complexity, requiring the development of a VM and bytecode generation tools, and poses debugging challenges. This pattern is most suitable when a large amount of sandboxed, modifiable behavior is needed and the trade-offs in complexity are acceptable.

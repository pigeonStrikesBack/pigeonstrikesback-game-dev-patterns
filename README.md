# Game Programming Patterns - Implementations in<!-- GDScript and--> JavaScript

This repository contains practical implementations of **Design Patterns** for game development, based on the book [Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).

Each pattern is accompanied by:

- 📖 A theoretical explanation from the book
- 🎮 Examples of use in video games
- 💻 Practical implementations in<!--**GDScript (Godot)** and--> **JavaScript**

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections:

### 1. `patterns/` - Theory and Use Cases

Contains explanations of each **design pattern** and examples of how they are used in video games.

example:

`command/` pattern

- Includes `README.md` with the **description of the Command Pattern**

<!--

### 2️. `gdscript/` - Implementations in Godot

Contains **GDScript** implementations of the patterns with practical exercises.

Each pattern has its own folder (`command/`, etc.) with:

- `README.md`
  
  Contains a reference to the theory (`patterns/command/README.md`) and describes the exercises.

- `ex_N_title/`
  
  Contains the file `ex_N_title.gd` with the exercise implementation.

-->


### 3️. `javascript/` - Implementations in JavaScript

Same structure as `gdscript/` but with code written in **JavaScript**.

### 4️. Other Important Files

- `README.md` → General index of the repository with a list of implemented patterns.

<!--
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` → Guidelines for contributing to the project.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pigeonStrikesBack/pigeonstrikesback-game-dev-patterns.git
cd pigeonstrikesback-game-dev-patterns
```

### 2️. Explore the Theory

Read the explanations in **`patterns/`** to understand how each pattern works.

### 3️. Try the Code

- To test the patterns in **Godot**, open the `gdscript/` folder in your project.
- To test the patterns in **JavaScript**, you can open the `.js` files in a browser using a simple `index.html`.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Study and implement the main **Design Patterns** used in video games.
- Write **clear**, **organized**, and **reusable** code.
- Improve programming skills in <!--**Godot** and--> **JavaScript**.
